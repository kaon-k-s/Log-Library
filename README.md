# Log-Library: Description
The Logging Library Project is a versatile and extensible logging framework designed for .NET applications. It provides a unified interface for logging messages using databases, files, and the console. This project aims to simplify the process of integrating logging functionality into applications, making it easier for developers to monitor application behavior, debug issues, and understand user interactions.

### **Flexibility**: Supports multiple logging strategies out-of-the-box, such as file-based logging, database logging, and console logging. Developers can easily switch between these strategies based on runtime configuration without changing the core application logic.
### **Extensibility**: The design allows for easy addition of new logging strategies, enabling developers to tailor the logging mechanism to specific project requirements.
### **Configuration-Based Activation**: Logging strategies can be activated or deactivated through simple configuration settings, providing control over which logging mechanisms are used at any time.
### **Severity Levels**: Incorporates predefined severity levels (ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG, INFO), allowing for granular control over the importance of logged messages.
